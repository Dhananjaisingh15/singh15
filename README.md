Data Visualization Challenge 

Thank you for your interest in the Data Visualization role at Blackstone. We invite you to complete this challenge as an important step in the  recruiting process. 
Download Data 
We will be exploring Lending Club’s loan origination data. Please download the dataset in CSV format (loan.csv) and associated dictionary  (LCDataDictionary.xlsx) from https://www.kaggle.com/puneeshk/lending-loan-club-dataset.  

Part 1: Data Exploration and Evaluation 
Familiarize yourself with the Lending Club data, as well as the business model of the company. Load the data and perform any necessary  cleaning and aggregations to assist in your understanding. Save the artifacts or outputs from this work (spreadsheets, Tableau files, etc.).  Describe your work with in a brief document that summarizes the process you followed. 


Part 2: Data Analysis and Visualization 
Analyze the data and create a visualization ("dashboard") to share this analysis with stakeholders. Assume that your audience will consist of  Lending Club senior management and their business teams. 
Please address these questions in the visualization: 
1.  
Assuming the loans with status that are "Current", "Issued" and "Fully Paid" can be called “Good Loans”, what is the percentage of Good  Loans for each loan segment? Please segment the loans by term length (36 or 60 month) and grade. 
2.  
Looking deeper at Good Loans, what can we learn from employment characteristics of the borrowers, such as job title and employment  length (years)? Are there any themes? 
3.  
What are the most frequent Purpose values for Bad Loans? What can we infer from this? 
Prioritize simplicity in your analysis and visualization. Explain your thought process and document any alternate approaches you considered  along the way. 
Finally, export the visualizations to Tableau Public, PDF or other shareable format. 

Mechanics 
Use the tools and techniques that you are most comfortable with. We primarily use Tableau, Python and SQL, but this is not a requirement. 
Save your documents and visualizations into a folder and zip it up, then return via email. Please assume that your work will be shared with data  visualization team members in a collaborative environment.
